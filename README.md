# Sushi-2-Go

## Information
### Description
Sushi 2 Go is a endless runner where you play as a shrimp sushi running on a conveyor belt trying to avoid obstacles and stay alive.
### History
During our first year at Future Games Malm√∂, we were tasked with creating an endless runner for Game Project 1. The project would take 3 weeks and we felt very satisfied with the finished project. And so we decided to continue working on it on our own time.
